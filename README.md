League Gothic
=============

_by [Caroline Hadilaksono](https://www.hadilaksono.com/), [Micah Rich](https://micahrich.com/), & [Tyler Finck](https://www.tylerfinck.com/)_

League Gothic is a revival of an old classic, and one of our favorite typefaces, Alternate Gothic #1.
It was originally designed by [Morris Fuller Benton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton) for the [American Type Founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders) Company in 1903.
The company went bankrupt in 1993, and since the original typeface was created before 1923, the typeface is in the public domain.

We decided to make our own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement.
Thanks to a commission from the fine & patient folks over at [WND.com](https://www.wnd.com/), it’s been revised & updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, and [Dannci](https://twitter.com/dannci), who contributed extra glyphs.
